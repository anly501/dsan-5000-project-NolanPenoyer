        "I will attempt to gather all the data I need to answer my 10 questions. Most of the data I acquire will come from [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/). I will use data tables from the U.S. Census Bureau's [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/ACS-supplemental-data.html) (ACS), a nationwide survey that collects and produces information on social, economic, housing, and demographic characteristics about our nation's population each year.\n",

        "I chose census data and specifically the ACS tables because, from experience and knowledge I have accumulated in my life, I inferred that the variables in these tables could be useful in predicting home prices. For example, one variable I will examine is the number of people with bachelor's degrees. Usually, higher education is linked to higher incomes, and therefore, higher home prices. The variables I choose to include from the tables may prove valuable or they may not; part of my analysis is determining which variables are the most important. Also, a lot of my variables are heavily correlated with each other, like total households and total married households. This can become an issue in the models I create as multicollinearity increases variance and makes it hard to know the impact of an individual variable in the model. I am aware of this and will address it later in my project.\n",

Ultimately, I will not need all the columns in the tables, but it will be nice to have easy access to them in my future analysis. I only went back to 2017 for now, but if I wanted to improve my models, I could retrieve more data. The same methodology will apply no matter how much data I acquire.\n",

The ZHVI was created to accurately capture the seasonally adjusted value of a typical property across the nation as opposed to just the homes that sold.

The overall sentiment can provide us with signals that people are overvaluing or undervaluing homes, or that a rise or drop in home prices may be pending. Knowing if the general public believes buying a home, especially in a certain state, is a smart decision, can tell us which direction prices are headed, depending if you agree with the general public or not. Another potential data science project I would like to study in the future is if market sentiment matches market performance, and if there is a lag between the two."
