Hello, everyone! My name is Nolan Penoyer, and I am currently a graduate student in the Data Science and Analytics program at Georgetown University. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in data science from the United States Air Force Academy. Upon graduation, I will work as an operations research analyst in the Air Force. Recently, the Air Force modernized and reclassified its position to focus more on information and big data. The direction the military is headed is clear, and I desire to be a leader in the implementation of the emerging tools in information and advanced analytics in support of the defense of the United States.
