# Housing Trends
In every aspect of life, discovering insights before others can give us a competitive advantage that will allow us to get ahead. In some activities we do, although we may know information others do not, the nature of the framework we are operating in may restrict how much utility we gain. For example, knowing the opponents next move in a game of checkers will only give us the satisfaction of winning the checkers game. However, other information is much more valuable because of the gravity of the affair in the larger scheme of life.

Shelter is a need that every human must have fulfilled. In the United States, 66% of Americans are homeowners. These homeowners on average have 70% of their net worth invested into their home. Real estate can also be highly profitable for those wanting to create cash flow from owning homes and multifamily homes. Therefore, it is easy to see that the housing market is one area where having insights that others do not have, like housing trends in a certain city or state, will give us a multitude of utility. I would like to buy a multifamily home after I graduate; if I knew what areas would provide me with consistent tenants and a property that goes up in value, I would be very much ahead of the game in the real estate realm and in life in general.

Like most problems in the real-world that heavily impact our lives, there are an overwhelming number of variables and factors that affect the real estate market. Furthermore, there are countless companies and people just like me who would like to uncover a method to reveal information about the market. I am not going to pretend that myself as one person will be successful in predicting whether a home’s price will go up or down a significant amount in the years to come, let alone the exact price of the home. However, I hope this project will reveal some insights that others and I can build off to better know what factors impact real estate the most and ultimately what direction these factors are driving the market.

As I said before, there are a multitude of underlying variables that I could focus on, but for the purposes of this project, I will use census data to attempt to reveal housing trends, specifically, if a home will go up in value or not and by how much. There are also different geography levels I could try to predict, from home prices on a certain street to home prices in a certain country, but I chose the state level as I do not know what state I would like to live in yet. Hopefully, the methods in this project can be replicated and applied to any geography level.

# What Has Already Been Done

In *The Winners in China’s Urban Housing Reform*, the researchers used census data to reveal who benefited from China's housing reform that privatized public housing. With the census data, they were able to estimate the housing subsidy received by renters in the public sector by examining private sector prices of houses of comparable quality and size. The census data contained information on six modes of housing tenure that could be compared and information on housing characteristics like housing space, number of bathrooms, ect. @doi:10.1080/02673030903240660. Although this study has a different end goal than me, I will use census data in a similar way to try to estimate housing prices.

In *House Price Prediction Using Regression Techniques: A Comparative Study*, the researchers attempt to forecast housing prices using different predictive techniques like multiple linear regression, LASSO, and gradient boosting among others @8882834. I could potentially use the same techniques to accomplish my goals.

# Questions I Want to Answer

* Which variable or variables in census data reveal the most about the direction of housing prices in a state?
* How do demographic trends play a role?
* Does age have an impact?
* Does sex have an impact?
* Does race have an impact?
* Does education level have an impact?
* Does migration data tell most of the story?
* How much are home prices impacted by trends in population?
* Can we predict which states to invest in in the United States?
* Can we predict which states are the best for landlords to have a steady flow of tenants?
